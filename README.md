# Athoring Pulic Documents

This is intended to be a resource for making public documents from GitHub, to Markdown, to licensimg. I don't plan to change this much after it is writtem and toyed with putting it on codepen—however—i wanted to keep it on GitHub to reduce the number of sites visited to get started.

# What Is Git?

Git is a Version Control System (VCS) that snapshots data during a commit. Think of every commit as a save state: you give it a human readable message so everyone knows what you did, and it makes a uuid to fall back to. I've used it daily since 2012.
